zjshen commenting on liyao1's diagram:
-since cars is a weak entity, car# should be labeled as weak key
-the attribute 'poster' in booking should be an attribute in request

zjshen commenting on hqi's diagram:
- booking is labeled as a relation but it is connected to two other relations, should change booking to an entity and add book as a relation
- it would be a good idea to change en-route from attribute to relation
- good solution to have review as an entity
- may be lacking constraints in various locations, may need to reconsider requirements and decide what restraints to add 

liyao1 commenting on ER diagram of zjshen:
- Since every ride is offered by a driver, it should be a weak entity which is
  related to drivers, hence offer is a weak relationship.
- Assuming each car is registered by a driver, and each driver is registered with
  a car. Then both of the car registered by driver and driver registering a car
  relationships should be total participation.

liyao1 commenting on ER diagram of hqi:
- review can be a relationship between members and ride, or other members.
- ride can be a weak entity related to drivers.
- Assuming each car is registered by a driver, and each driver is registered with
  a car. Then both of the car registered by driver and driver registering a car
  relationships should be total participation.

hqi commenting on zjshen's diagram:
booking and request should not be ISA Hierarchy of ride
there are lines that crossed each other
overall, the diagram is neat and clear

hqi commenting on liyao1's diagram:
