zjshen commenting on liyao1's diagram:
-since cars is a weak entity, car# should be labeled as weak key
-the attribute 'poster' in booking should be an attribute in request

liyao1 commenting on ER diagram of zjshen:
- Since every ride is offered by a driver, it should be a weak entity which is
  related to drivers, hence offer is a weak relationship.
- Assuming each car is registered by a driver, and each driver is registered with
  a car. Then both of the car registered by driver and driver registering a car
  relationships should be total participation.

- review can be a relationship between members and ride, or other members.
- ride can be a weak entity related to drivers.
- Assuming each car is registered by a driver, and each driver is registered with
  a car. Then both of the car registered by driver and driver registering a car
  relationships should be total participation.
